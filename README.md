# owrtconfig.sh and owrtflash-ng.sh

owrtconfig has to be re-written; however owrtflash-ng is new, as the name says.

Features are:
* flash via http, telnet or ssh over factory-, openwrt-, or custom-firmware
* network configuration with iproute2
* modular function design which is hopefully reuseable
